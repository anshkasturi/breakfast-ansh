                    <p>Wow, ok you must be very bored to be here but I'm glad you made it and honored to serve as your distraction from your work. If however, you are looking for some great food recommendation than you are also in the right place. This website is dual faceted. </p>
                    <p>In terms of content, here you will find things written from the perspective of a simple meal with little to no flare. Although I always enjoy a creatively presented dish, I am a believer in celebrity chef and masterchef judge Chef Alvin Leung's quote "Taste is King."</p>
                    <p>That's why you'll find my website to be refreshingly bare bones. No flashy designs or fancy graphics here â€“ just pure, plain focus on the essence of food. I believe that good taste speaks for itself and doesn't require extravagant presentation to impress.</p>

                    <h3>The Authors</h3>
                    <p>If you know me in real life, the first word that comes to your mind is probably lazy. In order to not shy from this reputation, I decided to allow my friends write for this website as well.</p>
                    <p>Doing so gives them an opportunity to share their culinary journey but also gives you the chance to read something that is not written by a boring, vocabularically challenged, comp sci student. Now you might be thinking that others writing might lower the quality of the recommendations but I have taken some steps to combat this.</p><br />
                    <ol className="about--list">
                        <li>Each author is a friend of mine whose recommendations I completely trust and frequently use.</li>
                        <li>Each post has been reviewed, approved, and edited by yours truly.</li>
                        <li>And most importantly is that you are taking me wayyyyy too seriously lol. I claim I'm a foodie and yet my favorite food is a Qdoba burrito bowl.</li>
                    </ol>
                    <p>But anyways, the authors are people I respect and if this ever gets big I'll reference them in my my Note to Self (iykyk). To learn more about them check out the Authors tab!</p>

                    <h3> The Food</h3>
                    <p> Ah the reason why this exists. The food is stuff that isn't too expensive and readily available. Here, you won't find Michelin starred restaurants or places you have to reserve months in advance. </p>
                    <p> The food that is featured will be food from restaurants near me that is affordable and available. If it ever seems like these restaurants are getting too out of your reach, it means that I have somehow become rich and then tbh I don't really care what you think since I am rich.</p>
                    <p> However, the more likely outcome is that I putting myself in financial trouble in which case, please do me a favor and reach out in the contact tab and tell me look at my bank account. </p>

                    <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                    <p> All in all (like I said terrible writing), I'm happy you chose me as your TikTok/Reels replacement for a few minutes and I promise to do my best in bringing you good content. If you ever have any thoughts please don't hesitate to reach out and I promise to read it. Thakn you for bearing with me and have a great rest of your day.</p>
